# CSE 401/M 501/P 501 Testing Utilities

This folder contains the source code of convenience testing utility methods
provided by the course staff, which are supplements to JUnit's assertion methods
that are designed to make testing your MiniJava compiler's overall behavior
easier.

We recommend using MiniJavaTestBuilder to build your unit test (helpers), but
if you need more customization/control, you can read the JavaDoc comments of
CSE401TestUtils.java to learn about what's available and how to use them.
