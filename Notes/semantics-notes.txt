We designed and implemented the ClassTable, MethodTable, and Type class together in the Symbols folder.
David implemented most of the logic for the FillSymbolTable class located in the AST/Visitor folder.
The two of use worked on implementing parts of TypeChecker.java separately and coming together in
the end to make sure all Exp were getting the correct type.
We added an extra field into Exp.java to keep track of the ASTNodes' type.
David set up the test runner class and made changes to MiniJava.java to be more modular.
While we were writing tests, we discovered a parser bug in the precedences of the
various operators. This was the only bug that had to be fixed from the earlier
phases of the project.
We tested our semantics and type check on the sample programs, pass all with no errors.
We also wrote our own test case to test for edge case and fixing any bugs we missed initially.
In the end all our tests ran with no unexpected errors.
