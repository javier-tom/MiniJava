David and Javier worked on the implementation of minijava.jflex and minijava.cup
together. One member would be behind the keyboard while the other provided a
second look to make sure things were implemented correctly. We divided writing
up the test samples, David wrote Comments, Simple, Methods, Integer Literals,
and Error (.java/.expected), and Javier wrote Delimiters, Keywords, Loops, and
Operators (.java/.expected).
