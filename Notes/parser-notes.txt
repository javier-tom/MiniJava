We changed the grammar for the given starter code to reflect the style of MiniJava online.
This means having Program/Goal at the root of our productions. Our grammar does not have any shift reduce conflicts.
We did not choose to add any extra features to our parser.
When working on the parser project, the two of us worked on the productions for the grammar together.
We went through MiniJava online to get the skeleton structure for our grammar and constructed our productions
based on the signatures of the ASTNodes.
We added the necessary nonterminals and precedence to make our grammar work.
We also worked on implementing the Abstract Syntax Tree together in ASTDump.java.
David set up the test builder. We split up creating the tests:
    David: Arrays.java/.expected, Simple.java/.expected
    Javier: If.java/.expected, Operators.java/.expected, While.java/.expected
